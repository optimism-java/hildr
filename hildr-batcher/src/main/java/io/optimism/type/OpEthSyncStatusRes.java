   * @param currentL1 The L1 block that the derivation process is currently at in the inner-most
   *     stage. This may not be fully derived into L2 data yet. The safe L2 blocks were
   *     produced/included fully from the L1 chain up to and including this L1 block. If the node is
   *     synced, this matches the HeadL1, minus the verifier confirmation distance.
   * @param currentL1Finalized The L1 block that the derivation process is currently accepting as
   *     finalized. in the inner-most stage, This may not be fully derived into L2 data yet. The
   *     finalized L2 blocks were produced/included fully from the L1 chain up to and including this
   *     L1 block. This may lag behind the FinalizedL1 when the FinalizedL1 could not yet be
   *     verified to be canonical w.r.t. the currently derived L2 chain. It may be zeroed if no
   *     block could be verified yet.
   * @param headL1 HeadL1 is the perceived head of the L1 chain, no confirmation distance. The head
   *     is not guaranteed to build on the other L1 sync status fields, as the node may be in
   *     progress of resetting to adapt to a L1 reorg.
   * @param safeL1 SafeL1 points to the L1 block.
   * @param finalizedL1 Already finalized L1 block.
   * @param unsafeL2 UnsafeL2 is the absolute tip of the L2 chain, pointing to block data that has
   *     not been submitted to L1 yet. The sequencer is building this, and verifiers may also be
   *     ahead of the SafeL2 block if they sync blocks via p2p or other offchain sources.
   * @param safeL2 SafeL2 points to the L2 block that was derived from the L1 chain. This point may
   *     still reorg if the L1 chain reorgs.
   * @param finalizedL2 FinalizedL2 points to the L2 block that was derived fully from finalized L1
   *     information, thus irreversible.
   * @param queuedUnsafeL2 UnsafeL2SyncTarget points to the first unprocessed unsafe L2 block. It
   *     may be zeroed if there is no targeted block.
